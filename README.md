## Getting Started

After getting the starter files, you need to go the file directory and run

```shell
npm install
```

and after that start the live server.

```shell
npm start
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
